 To install just run as root:

	# make install

 You also can use PREFIX and DESTDIR environment variables:

	# make install PREFIX="/usr"
	# make install DESTDIR="/usr/bin"

 Note: if you are using PREFIX variable then 
DESTDIR = ${PREFIX}/bin. Default value of PREFIX is "/usr/local".

 To uninstall run:

	# make uninstall PREFIX="/usr"

 Note: you'll need to use PREFIX again.
